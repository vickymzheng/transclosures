# transclosures

This repository is for reproducibility purposes, we provide all details regarding data preparation here. 
To validate our proposed approach we implemented our transitive closure and incremental component counting algorithm. 

The simulated dataset can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1itq6n2P_4MUXDMs_v6TYe3EjTUWhZ7x0/view?usp=sharing
The real world dataset can be found here: https://github.com/LomanLab/mockcommunity

Once you have downloaded the simulated data, uncompress it with the command:
