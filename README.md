# transclosures

This repository is for reproducibility purposes, we provide all details regarding data preparation here. 
To validate our proposed approach we implemented our transitive closure and incremental component counting algorithm. 

The simulated dataset can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1itq6n2P_4MUXDMs_v6TYe3EjTUWhZ7x0/view?usp=sharing
The real world dataset can be found here: https://github.com/LomanLab/mockcommunity

Once you have downloaded the simulated data, uncompress it with the command: 
gunzip sim_reads25k.fasta.gz

Our software is located in stream_cc.cpp. In order to compile it, you must have: 
boost (to be able to use lboost_program_options)
gcc

We have tested this with boost version 1.71.0 and gcc version 4.2.1

You can compile the application with the command `make`

An example edge file from the simulated dataset can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1osPUDSJ9BBwEoegCvom9yaBM9iZ-BCfA/view?usp=sharing

Edge files must follow the format:

```read_id1	readid2	readlen1	readlen2	overlaplen	read1_orient	read2_orient```

You will use nano-tools-stream.cpp to stream the edge file. In order to stream the file, we use a parallel hash map. You will need this too if you would like to stream the edge file. parallel-hashmap can be found here: https://github.com/greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap
It is also included in this repository as a submodule. 

You can stream an edge file with the command:

```./nano-tools-stream [edge file] [random seed]```

With the edge file provided, you can stream it with the command:

 ```./nano-tools-stream sim-reads25k_ov1000.edges 1```

If you want to feed this stream into our program for processing, you can do this using the pipe like so:

 ```./nano-tools-stream sim-reads25k_ov1000.edges 1 | ./stream_cc```

You can get instructions on how to use our program with the command:

`./stream_cc -h`

stream_cc produces 8 output files: 
* default_out.component_convergence
* default_out.component_sizes
* default_out.irreducible_degree
* default_out.irreducible_edges
* default_out.removal_rate
* default_out.storage_rate
* default_out.trans_mapping
* default_out.trans_stats
